<u><h1>Table Tennis</h1></u>
A 19th Century&#39;s game, Table Tennis (TT in short) was first played by the royal class British 
officers in India, as an after-dinner parlour game. It was played in 1880&#39;s Victorian England
with a row of books at the center of the table, forming the net and 2 more books serving a rackets. A golf ball was hit 
across the net, by 2 people holding the rackets(books). As of now it is a unisexual game.

As Table Tennis is a very technical game, including special requirements, it is necessary to
play the game properly, or else the charm goes away.So, for that, you first need to acquire proper
stance, which includes -
<br><ul>
<li>Standing a bit on the non-playing arm side from the midline.
<li>Playing arm side leg slightly behind non playing arm side's leg.</li>
<li>Comfortable distance between the 2 legs, and proper distance between body and table.</li>
<li>90<sup>o</sup> angle between forearm and backarm, considering elbow point as the vertex</li>
<li>Flexible body, bent at knees and waist.
<li>Keen determination, and eyes ALWAYS on the ball, during the game duration.
</ul>
