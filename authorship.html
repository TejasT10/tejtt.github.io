Table Tennis, after it was recognised as an international sport and after it was given the
high status, it began to revolutionize. A new organisation, International Table Tennis Federation
(popularly known as ITTF) was formed in 1926 and it was recognized as the governing body for 
all TT associations. Its role was overseeing rules and regulations and seeking technical 
improvements. The World Championships and Major titles are conducted by the ITTF. It is based
in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Thomas Weikert as its Current President.

<br>Table Tennis was first included in  Olympics, in Summer Olympics 1988 in Seoul. It was a part
of the Paralympics since its start, in 1960.The South-East Asia and Europe were the most interested
in this sport, with India included. Then the Americans started to like it too. This sport then 
grew to commercial importance and it joined the list of sports to be showed on the television,
