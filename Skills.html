<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><u>Grips</u></font>
<br>There are 3 kinds of grips, i.e. ways of holding the racket in Table tennis-
<ol>
<li>Penhold (2 types- Chinese and Traditional, it is named so because the racket is held like we
hold the pen)
<li>Shakehand (it is named so because the racket is held like we&#39;re shaking hands with the racket)
<li>Seemiller (it is named after the American TT legend Danny Seemiller, who used it)
</li></li></li></ol>
<li><font color="blue"><u>Offensive strokes</u></font>
<br>There are several types of offensive strokes in Table tennis, which are used to dominate
the play and a skilled player is required to play them. The attacking(offensive) strokes 
are important as they help the player gain quick points. Examples -
<ol>
<li>Hit
<li>Loop
<li>Counter-hit
<li>Flip
<li>Smash
</li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<li><font color="blue"><u>Defensive strokes</u></font>
<br> As we know, to every attack there has to be a counter-attack and defensive strokes in TT
are meant for the same but that isn&#39;t their exact description. They are used to keep the point,
not let the opponent attack and create opportunities. To gain a point by playing defensive strokes,
the player either waits for the opponent to commit a mistake, or the player himself starts 
attacking once he is set. Examples-
<ol>
<li>Push
<li>Chop
<li>Block
<li>Lob
</li></li></li></li></ol>
<li><font color="blue"><u>Spin</u></font>
<br>Spin, a very effective factor in both offence and defence, is used primarily to deceive and
confuse the opponent about the position of the ball and make him swing the racket in the wrong
direction, though a very good player can make out the type and magnitude of spin. Making the 
ball spin is a delicate and skill-requiring task and the wrong move can make the things turn
upside down. Types of spin-
<ol>
<li>Backspin
<li>Topspin
<li>Sidespin
<li>Corkspin
</li></li></li></li></ol>
</li></li></li></li></ul>
