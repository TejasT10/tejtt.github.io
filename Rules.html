    <i><font color="red"><h2 align="center">The rules of the game-</h4></font></i>
<ul>
<li><font color="red"><u>Start</u></font>
<br>The game consists of 2 players and a referee, who solves all disputes during the match and
sees that the game goes according to the rules. The players play the game and try their best
to follow the rules. The game starts as the coin toss or the ball toss is done. In the coin toss,
the winner of the toss is decided by tossing the coin, and in the ball toss, one of the player 
hides the ball in his hands and then the other player guesses where the ball is. If he is 
correct, he wins the toss, else his opponent wins it. The winner of the toss gets to choose 
either the serve or the side he wants.
<li><font color="red"><u>Service (Serve)</u></font>
<br>After the server is decided, the game starts. If the game consists of sets of 11 points, 
the serve will change on every 2 points(i.e. after every 2 serves, the server will change),
or if its a &#39;21 points-per set&#39; game, then the serve changes after every 5 serves. The legal 
serve should be made such that the ball, after hitting the server&#39;s racket, tips in the server&#39;s
court once, in the opponent&#39;s court once but not hit the net(A game consists of 3 or 5 sets 
and according to current rules, one set can only be played for 11 points). 
<li><font color="red"><u>Return</u></font>
<br>After a legal service is made, the opponent who is on the receiving end of the service, has
to make a legal return. For that he must return the ball, i.e. he must hit the coming ball such
that it lands directly into the server&#39;s court, without touching his court. Though the ball can
touch the net and land in server&#39;s court, it will still be considered as a legal return. Then,
to continue the play, the server must hit the ball again directly into the opponent&#39;s court. 
<br>The play goes on in this way, until any of the players break the cycle. 
<li><font color="red"><u>Scoring</u></font>
<br>A point is scored by server under these circumstances-
<br>When the opponent fails to make a legal serve. 
<br>When the opponent fails to make a legal return. 
<br>When the opponent hits the ball out of the table.
<br>When the opponent handles the ball deliberately.
<br>When the opponent strikes the ball twice, successively.
<br>When the opponent moves the playing surface or touches the net.
<br>When the opponent&#39;s free hand touches the table(court).
<br>When the opponent commits 3 offences in a match (the opponent is warned by the referee on
committing 2 offences, but if the opponent still commits a third offence, then the server gains
2 (technical) points).
<li><font color="red"><u>Deuce and Alternation of ends</u></font>
<br>If both the players reach on such a point where they need only one point to win the set,
then the Deuce(Expedite system) is introduced by the referee. To win the game, the players have
to win the Deuce, for that they need to win 2 consecutive points without letting the 
opponent score in that duration. The server changes after every point. After a set is successfully
completed, the players change their ends and the server becomes the opponent. The player who
was the opponent in the previous set becomes the server.
<li><font color="red"><u>Doubles game</u></font>
<br>The doubles game is played between 2 pairs of players, with each pair of players at one end
of the table. The rules for the doubles game are the same as the rules of the singles game except
for-
<br><i>Service</i>- the line dividing the court in 2 rectangles and cutting it longitudinally
plays a major role here. The serve should be such that the ball tips in the box in front of the
server(one of the 2 players, on one end)and not in the box which is exactly in front of the box
which is in the front of the server, but in the box which is beside that box i.e. the box 
which is diagonal to the server.
<br><i>Order of Play</i>- players must hit the ball in turn and follow the same order of 
hitting throughout the set. Also, at the change of each service, the receiver becomes the server
and the partner of the server becomes the receiver.
